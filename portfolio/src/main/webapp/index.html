      <h3>Fun Fact About Me!</h3>
      <p>During quarantine I've been making weekly batches of granola for my family to enjoy on top of the pastries, 
        cookies and cakes I've made. Baking has been a favorite pastime of mine for a long time but I've recently 
        started to get more into the savory side of cooking. Two of the best dishes I've made recently are scallion 
        pancakes and baked ricotta stuffed shells.
