      <h1>Diego's Portfolio</h1>
      <p>This is my portfolio.</p>
      <p>Hi! I am a rising Junior at Columbia University studying Computer Science focusing on Theory and Algorithms. I am from Napa, CA and am currently quarantined at home with my parents and my cat Valentino and two pups Nala, and Louie.</p>

      <p>I love to bake! (cookies and pies are my favorite to do). During quarantine I've been making weekly granola batches for my family to enjoy. I've recently started to get more into the savory side of cooking and am trying to improve my cooking skills (especially since I'm starting to be a vegetarian). The two favorite dishes I've made recently is a veggie and tofu stir fry and ricotta stuffed shells baked in a Marinara sauce.</p>
